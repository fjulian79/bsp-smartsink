# bsp-stm32-f103
A board support package for stm32 nucleo f103 based projects.

The master is intended to provide only common things. 
If something specific to a derived PCB has to be implemented, this has to be done on a branch. 
Currently there are the following branches:

| Branch        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| master        | For the stm32 nucleo f103 board. Generic functions only. |
| smartsink     | For the PCB used in the smart sink project. |
